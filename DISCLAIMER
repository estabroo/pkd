This software includes a kernel module that might have bugs.  These bugs could result in a system crash via a kernel panic. Use at your own risk. Please try this first on non-essential systems and be comfortable with how it works before you put in on anything that has any value.

If you do find any bugs or weaknesses please let me know as soon as possible via email <eric@urbanrage.com>

Also remember to synchronize the clocks (ntp works great for this).
